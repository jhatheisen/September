# Accessibility Notes

reddit

-Not compliant
-no accessible name for buttons
-background and foreground not enough contrast for color blind
-no alt attribute for some buttons
-some links not discernable  name
-not able to freeze the gifs and moving objects, by default
-could cause seizures for those with it

~ generally not too bad, kinda rare cases for buttons, except for background and gifs
