# Design Notes

Instagram

is very minimalistic
When size increased additional options to add are given
Most suited to phones since all content is long ways
Buttons are at top, but somewhat confusing to those who don't use insta, but get use to soon after
maybe have name on highlight, for explore

Reddit

is very good, has all afore mentioned aspects
maybe could make the titles for posts easier to differentiate, kinda hared to tell from first glance
make the accound who posted it bigger
Also maybe make upvote button closer to right
cause we read left to right, and end at right, so easier to rate than on left, also make comments and stuff hang right
